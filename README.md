## How to run

<span style="color:gold">**NOTE:**</span> It is recommended that you use a Python virtual environment to avoid conflict with your global packages, and to keep your global Python installation clean. 

On your terminal, make sure that you have the environment activated for the client script to have access to all required packages:

- Python Virtualenv:

   ```bash
   ./venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

- Conda:

   ```bash
   conda activate ./envs
   ```


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Refer to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for package dependencies and their versions.

Then run from the first notebook
